tech notes:

- we might use the socketpairs as a bidir queue by pushing the addresses to messages in the socket: no more need for
  queue mutexes as the pusher relinquishes control while the receiver will obtain it by reading the pointer from the
  socket. PROBLEM: how can we safely discard messages originating from terminated/crashed threads? (This is also
  an issue for a 'regular' queue...)
