
- process the market scanner XML: use it to fire additional market scanner requests to aumatically collect a 'reasonable' set of stocks with their ticker codes, etc. for further use by the application.

- integrate libxml as a submodule

- integrate pthreads-Win32 as a submodule

- integrate zlib as a submodule

- integrate proprietary / custom logic as a submodule  (or 'plugin')

- integrate hamsterdb as a submodule

- use hamsterdb to store the stock and scanner data bulk

- add web pages and JavaScript graphing (d3.js/cube) for viewing the stock data

- integrate d3.js as a submodule

- migrate Excel/etc. work & keep/make it portable

tech notes:

- we might use the socketpairs as a bidir queue by pushing the addresses to messages in the socket: no more need for
  queue mutexes as the pusher relinquishes control while the receiver will obtain it by reading the pointer from the
  socket. PROBLEM: how can we safely discard messages originating from terminated/crashed threads? (This is also
  an issue for a 'regular' queue...)
  --> implemented
  
- come up with something nice & easy for the various serialization/deserialization spots in the code.
  Had a look at libs11n but it doesn't seem a good fit. Have to consider this some more.
  
  Another thought there is to use OpenSSL's ASN.1 code as a starter to serialize the class data to the database, but that
  doesn't translate well when we move to using a SQL-based database for some stuff; rather, ASN.1 would be one of the
  I/O formats next to SQL and JSON.
