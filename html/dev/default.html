			<h2>Technical Core Design Considerations</h2>
			<ul>
				<li>The machine should be reachable from various places, 
				including those where you cannot, may not or would not (for 
				security reasons) install your own software bundle. Hence the 
				entire machinery is web based: all you should need is a modern 
				browser.</li>
				<li>The machine will run certain processes 24/7 or at least 
				during and around stock market opening hours, without permanent 
				human supervision and/or direction. For reasons of performance 
				assurance and security, these processes should run server-side.</li>
				<li>Algorithms are expected to mutate continuously. This means 
				that the machine must provide means to allow for Rapid 
				Development, including algorithm scripting and testing.</li>
				<li>Ideally, the machine should be able to run 'what if' 
				scenario tests and other types of algorithm tests alongside 
				regular trading. This may best be solved by having two servers 
				operational: one for trading and another for testing, in order 
				to keep the different concerns separate. (After all, algorithms 
				may employ tuning operations that run the entire test range 
				gamut; this and other factors of sooftware development strongly 
				suggest using separate machines. To keep transfer costs as low 
				as possible, multiple nodes should therefor be able to share the 
				'live data': <em>One Feed For All</em>. </li>
			</ul>
			<h2>Functional Core Design Considerations</h2>
			<ul>
				<li>Remote human interaction is intended to be limited to 
				'approval' and 'rejection' operations only: this means that the 
				machine may suggest certain activities and wait for human 
				approval, but the human operator will not be allowed to enforce 
				their own initiative, i.e. trigger buy/sell/... operations on 
				their own. This is both to prevent remote security breaches from 
				being a total disaster and to prevent 'emotional responses' in 
				dire times.</li>
				<li>The only 'direct instruction' any human is allowed to give 
				the machine is to 'abort the mission' at any time. This means 
				that pending orders are to be cancelled, while positions are 
				liquidated and any further 'buy' operations are withheld until 
				further notice (human approval). Depending on the 
				human-indicated 'severity' at the time of 'abort', position 
				liquidation may be performed.</li>
				<li>Several years of user experience have shown that 'looking at 
				numbers' is an extremely tiring task. Hence it is paramount to 
				provide the best possible graphical means of viewing the data 
				and reviewing the machine activity. It also means that any human 
				feedback, e.g. suggesting buy/sell positions and similar data 
				points, should be entirely handled in the graphic. (One might 
				start off with the IB/TWS Chart Trader idea and take it from 
				there.)</li>
			</ul>
			<h2>Implementation Details</h2>
			<ul>
				<li>mongoose was picked as a starting point for the server. 
				Apache and Node.js have been considered as well; apache was 
				rejected as a choice as it was too hard (too much to learn about 
				the API at the time) to create an augmented version suitable to 
				our particular needs - the jury is still dubious on that 
				decision though; Node.js was rejected as it has a significant 
				risk of 'locking up' due to it's single-threaded nature. Web 
				Workers might help there but the core was not considered 
				suitable for what is ultimately a trading platform. For that, we 
				must be in control of every line of code in the core - both 
				physically and mentally.</li>
				<li>As we are looking for ways to allow Rapid Development 
				possible for the algorithms, we intend to provide a development 
				mode which runs entirely in the browser/client - this goes 
				against the security considerations mentioned above but it gives 
				us a far better debugging environment where scripting 
				(JavaScript) is concerned.<br />
				JavaScript is picked as the language of choice for any work in 
				the front-end; we have pondered including a JavaScript engine in 
				the backend (thus turning mongoose in some sort of 
				multi-threaded Node.js server) so that developed algorithms take 
				0 time to become production-ready, but here too the jury is 
				still out: adding the JavaScript interpreter to the backend 
				gives it a lot of 'Node.js' feel and since we have reaons not to 
				pick that one, why build one that's very similar?<br />
				The alternative is transformation of the algorithms to C++ 
				before moving them to production, but that introduces the 
				drawback of reduced expressiveness (no closures, etc. in C++) 
				and bugs in the translation, plus it makes 'tweaking' all that 
				much tougher.<br />
				We are, however, quite sure about one thing: adding heavy 
				interpreters with little or no debugging support to the backend 
				is a wrong choice, no matter what other considerations suggest 
				them. We are considering using Lua as a backend script for 
				configurability and 'tweakability' of any algorithms running at 
				the back-end, but there's the ever looming threat of the lacking 
				'development environment' for any backend scripting; 
				Node.js/JavaScript allegedly has a good remote debugger solution 
				now, but I am unsure about other scripting languages. Research 
				indicates that the remote debugging support for JavaScript is 
				better than for others, mostly due to the Node.js hype. 
				(Reminder to self: others ride the V8 JS + node-inspector 
				bandwagon, e.g. the Laboratory2D game engine.)</li>
