When it is still a 'spare', it'll show in agony green.</p>\n  <p>Note, however, that -1px 'correction hack' isn't covering worst-case as you CTRL-scrollwheel / zoom out: Henry the First will still be pushed out at some zoom levels. This is due to the accumulation of rounddown errors in the <code>getComputedSize()</code> method: it is not at fault per se, it's just that this call shows that you need to analyze the internals of your JS framework (moo, jq, whatever) to determine the correct rounddown 'error expression'; and thus 'worst-case error compensation value': we're better off with -2px correction here, as Number Three will prove, below.\n  </p>\n  <div id=\"container-2\">\n    <div class=\"first\">\n      <h1>Henry The First</h1>\n      <p>Here I am, jiggle that CTRL+scroll-wheel of yours and here I am not... <strong>occasionally</strong>.

Blame (most of) the .toInt() calls in there instead.</li>\n    <li>CSS dimensions should be treated as float values, rather than integers, to make sure that the error component in any subsequent calculations will, with extremely high probability, remain 1px or less - I won't ever say it'll be (0)zero as that is plain wrong, given that floating point calculations are implicitly inaccurate all by themselves.</li>\n  <div id=\"container-3\">\n    <div class=\"first\">\n      <h1>Henry The First</h1>\n      <p>Here I am, jiggle that CTRL+scroll-wheel of yours and here I am not... <strong>occasionally</strong>.
